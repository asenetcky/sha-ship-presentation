# What is out there? {background-color="#3371E7"}


## The Methodology
- I searched the web using combintations of:
  - "STATE_NAME state health assessment"
  - "STATE_NAME state health improvement plan"
  - My classifications are *not* perfect
  - How I categorized thing changed over time
    - but the highlights remained the same

## The Methodology
- ASTHO has a list of documents from states
  - Not every state was represented and many links were broken

## The Methodology
- Healthy People 2030 had a list of SHIPs
  - Decent for SHIPS - which often lead to finding SHAs - but not always
  - Not every state and not every link was live
  - Not always the latest

## The Methodology
- It wasn't easy  to find everything
  - Some states used their **own jargon**
  - Some documents ***only accessible through search engines***
  - Websites **difficult to navigate** - not always a common landing page for SHA/SHIP
  - Tried used an AI agent - it struggled and ultimately **wasn't useful**

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

library(dplyr)
library(nanoparquet)
library(ggplot2)

data <-
  nanoparquet::read_parquet("state-sha-ship.parquet") |>
  filter(
    !state_territory %in% c("astho", "healthy people in state and territories")
  )

yikes <-
  data |>
  filter(yikes == 1)

star <-
  data |>
  filter(star == 1)

interesting <-

  filter(interesting == 1)

# Noteworthy or Interesting {background-color="#3371E7"}

# The Good

## Louisiana
![Louisiana Landing Page](louisiana.png)

## Louisiana
[https://ldh.la.gov/bureau-of-planning-performance/shaship](Louisiana)

- Louisiana I think did a really nice job.
- They did use a paid platform: [`mySidewalk`](https://www.mysidewalk.com/)
- However, I think regardless of the platform - it was organized well.

## Louisiana
[https://ldh.la.gov/bureau-of-planning-performance/shaship](Louisiana)

  - SHA & SHIP together on a landing page
    - Searchable from Google - *it is however* buried and somewhat difficult
    to find navigating through the site naturally
    - The Site in general looks great and you *can* technically navigate to
    it from within the site 

## Louisiana
[https://ldh.la.gov/bureau-of-planning-performance/shaship](Louisiana)

  - Mixed media
    - Snippets on webpage
    - Downloadable in-depth reports and small one-two pagers
    - "Website Dashboard" - if you want to use it - feels natural to use

## The Majority

```{r}
#| label: content-count
#| echo: false

data |>
  mutate(
    content_platform = if_else(
      content_platform == "wesbite",
      "website",
      content_platform
    )
  ) |>
  count(content_platform) |>
  mutate(
    perc = round(n / sum(n), 2) * 100,
    perc = paste0(perc, "%"),
    content_platform = stringr::str_to_title(content_platform),
    content_platform = forcats::fct_reorder(content_platform, n)
  ) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(content_platform, n), col = "black", fill = "#3371E7") +
  geom_text(aes(content_platform, n, label = perc), hjust = -0.25) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    title = "SHA/SHIP Content Types",
    y = "Count",
    x = ""
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10)
  )

```

## The Majority

- They almost all look the same. 
- When it is one enormous document - without any kind of summary:
  - I always ask myself who is the intended audience?
  - Does the content match up with that audience?
  - Could all the audiences be better served by smaller, more diverse content?

## The Overwhelming
[Massachusetts](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/state-health-assessment-sha)

- Massachusetts - slick visuals and endless combos of reports
  - The complexity!
  - Where is the narrative - no really I couldnt find it
  - Looks like a nightmare to maintain
  - Only self-service


## Box Ticking
- Painful to use: New York, Kansas, Maine, South Carolina
- KPI lists or Scorecards with little or no context (that was easily found): 
  - Hawaii, DC

## The Broken
- Broken links: Florida, Utah, Virginia
- Nothing!?: Michigan, West Virginina(since 2000, whispers in 2017...)
- Ohio dashboard 
  - Comes from a good place; but is a dashbaord leasing to 50 other dashboards
  - The dashboards are 
  [so crammed full of content](https://analytics.das.ohio.gov/t/ODHDPPUB/views/SHA_FINAL_Domain_LeadingCausesDeath/02_COD?%3Aembed=y&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Alinktarget=_self) - you can't make sense of it

# The Takeaway {background-color="#3371E7"}

## Where do we stack up?

- We are in "good" company
  - We have an enormous, expensive looking pdf - like almost everyone else.
- There are opportunities here for innovation and cost-savings that could
make us leaders in this space

## Where do we stack up?

- The [SHIP page](https://portal.ct.gov/dph/state-health-planning/healthy-connecticut/healthy-connecticut-2025)
looks pretty decent - but if I navigate to say the SHA. I can't find that page
again without using "back" in my browser or googling. Only the SHIP Policy Agenda
is on the sidebar
- The [SHA page](https://portal.ct.gov/dph/state-health-planning/healthy-connecticut/healthy-ct-2025-state-health-assessment) is leaving website real estate
on the table by not telling some kind of narrative up front. It's *only* links
to pdfs bits and pieces
